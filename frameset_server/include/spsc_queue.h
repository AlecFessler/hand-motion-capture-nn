/**
 * This implementation uses two structs, one
 * for the producer, and one for the consumer.
 * The reasoning for this is because it prevents
 * false sharing between the threads. However,
 * naively implementing a single struct with padding
 * puts other key info, like the capacity or buffer
 * ptr in a separate cache line. Benchmarking demonstrated
 * that this absolutely crippled IPC (instructions per cycle)
 * by requiring multiple cache lines to complete an operation.
 * The dual struct approach provides the best of both worlds,
 * prevents false sharing, but also keeps everything needed
 * by a single thread in a single cache line. The only real
 * cost is a ptr dereference to read the other threads data,
 * but the head/tail caching optimization also limits the
 * frequency of this happening as well.
 *
 * The actual capacity of the queue is size - 1, because
 * the queue needs to maintain a single empty slot to
 * distinguish between queue full (head + 1 == tail)
 * and queue empty (head == tail) states.
