- Add a retry count on empty frames and frameset retry loops in the frameset server so it doesn't get stuck running forever

- Use a smaller sapiens model and maybe fewer keypoints to try to get real time pose prediction

- Finish writing and updating docstrings

- Update Readme based on new architecture
